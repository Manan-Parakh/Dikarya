Progress Log - 2025-11-08
--------------------------------
1. Added missing GUI dependency (PyQt5) to requirements.txt so installations cover all imports.
2. Created data_insert.py to persist experiment records to CSV in a thread-safe manner.
3. Implemented data_get.py to read historical experiment data from the log and filter by date/experiment.
4. Converted the dashboard window from fullscreen to a centered resizable popup, then ensured it locks to content minimums and later restored fullscreen behavior with resizable frame.
5. Reworked layout sizing (combo boxes, inputs, buttons, logos, data retrieval pane) to use dynamic size policies for responsive resizing.
6. Ensured the graph area maintains a minimum height to avoid compression on load.
7. Enhanced historical data retrieval to update UI labels and plots, including helper methods for data cleaning and plotting.
8. Added a data history display mode, preventing live updates from clearing retrieved plots until a new experiment starts.
9. Implemented a CLEAR button that resets labels, plots, and state to baseline.
